    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      BookABite was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to bring the best of 
      Italian cuisine to San Francisco. Our journey began with a love for food, 
      family, and community, and we have been dedicated to serving our guests ever 
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      From our humble beginnings as a small eatery, we have grown into a beloved 
      destination for locals and visitors alike. Each dish is crafted with fresh, 
      locally sourced ingredients and a sprinkle of love.
