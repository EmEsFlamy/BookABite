        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            BookABite was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to bring the best of 
            Italian cuisine to San Francisco. Our journey began with a love for food, 
            family, and community, and we have been dedicated to serving our guests ever 
            since.
          </p>
          <p>
            From our humble beginnings as a small eatery, we have grown into a beloved 
            destination for locals and visitors alike. Each dish is crafted with fresh, 
            locally sourced ingredients and a sprinkle of love.
